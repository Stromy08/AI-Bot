Training an AI to play a game based on videos and corresponding mouse/keystrokes involves several steps and requires a good understanding of machine learning, computer vision, and possibly reinforcement learning. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: You'll need to preprocess your videos and keystroke logs to create a dataset that an AI model can learn from. This might involve:
   - Extracting frames from the videos at a consistent rate.
   - Synchronizing the frames with the corresponding mouse/keystrokes from the `.txt` file.
   - Labeling the data with the correct actions taken at each frame.

2. **Feature Extraction**: You'll need to decide what features from the video frames are relevant for the AI to learn the game. This could include:
   - The entire raw pixel data from each frame.
   - Certain regions of interest within the frames.
   - Higher-level features extracted using computer vision techniques.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model. For a task like this, you might consider:
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for processing visual data.
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for handling sequential data like keystrokes and mouse movements.
   - Reinforcement learning algorithms if you want the AI to improve through trial and error.

4. **Training**: Train your model on the preprocessed and labeled dataset. This will involve:
   - Feeding the input data (video frames) into the model.
   - Comparing the model's output (predicted actions) with the actual actions from your `.txt` file.
   - Adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual actions.

5. **Evaluation**: Test the trained model on new, unseen data to evaluate its performance. This helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to new situations.

6. **Iteration**: Based on the model's performance, you may need to go back and adjust your preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, or training process.

7. **Deployment**: Once you have a model that performs well, you can deploy it to play the game autonomously.

This is a complex task that requires significant expertise in machine learning and game development. You'll likely need to use machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and you may need to write custom code to handle the game environment and interface with the game itself.

If you're new to machine learning, you might want to start with simpler projects and work your way up to this. There are also pre-built environments and tools like OpenAI Gym that provide a framework for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which could be helpful for this kind of project.
